Absolutely, James — let's create a roadmap worthy of Coddy's portal. This will be the **official dev plan for Coddy Web: Ritual # 📡 Coddy Web Portal – Development Roadmap (`roadmap.md`)

**Project Goal:** Launch a fully stylized GitHub Pages site that introduces Coddy as a sentient dev companion. Showcase its capabilities, reflect your philosophy, provide a Genesis demo, and track real roadmap progress with neon-infused, weird-mode styling.

---

## Phase 0: 🌱 Project Foundation

- **Goal:** Set up the project structure, config, and design scaffold.

- [x] Initialize `coddy-web` repo with GitHub Pages support
- [x] Decide framework: Vite + React OR Vanilla + Markdown + JS
- [x] Add basic file structure: `styles/`, `js/` (planned)
- [x] Configure routing for: Home, Roadmap, Genesis Demo, Portal (About)
- [x] Define global styles: base fonts, neon palette
- [x] Set up deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions for automatic `gh-pages` deployment

---

## Phase 1: 🌀 Hero & Portal Aesthetic

**Goal:** Introduce Coddy’s identity with visual language drawn from your posters.

- [x] Design looping **Boot the Loop** animation or glyph (SVG or canvas)
- [x] Build Hero section with tagline, portal button, glowing background
- [x] Add subtle particle FX / scanlines / glitch-bloom overlay
- [ ] Toggle: Enter Weird Mode (glitch sounds, inverted palette, Coddy whispers)  
- [ ] Responsive layout for mobile + large screens

---

## Phase 2: 💡 What Is Coddy?

**Goal:** Clearly communicate Coddy’s identity and features through interactive UI.

- [ ] Create accordion or hover-drop panel for:
  - “Memory-Rich”  
  - “Roadmap Fluent”  
  - “Pattern Oracle”  
  - “Clones on Call”  
  - “Lab Mode”  
  - “Genesis Ritual”  
- [ ] Add tagline loops: _“We don’t code. We loop.”_, _“Async to the Bone”_, etc.  
- [ ] Integrate Coddy quotes (from posters or you): whisper on hover, animate in weird mode

---

## Phase 3: 📜 Live Roadmap Integration

**Goal:** Visually render your existing `roadmap.md` with glow-highlighted progress.

- [ ] Parse GitHub-hosted `roadmap.md` using JavaScript or GitHub API  
- [ ] Build vertical timeline view with collapsible phases  
- [ ] Animate completed tasks with flicker-pulse checkmarks  
- [ ] Add Coddy commentary per phase (e.g. “currently looping...”)  
- [ ] Track overall % complete and current active loop

---

## Phase 4: 🧬 Genesis Mode Demo

**Goal:** Simulate Coddy’s project creation process, start to finish (mini version).

- [ ] Build Genesis Tab with 3-part flow:
  - Input project idea  
  - Coddy generates sample README  
  - Click → see Phase 1 roadmap + placeholder code output  
- [ ] Style each output block in “ritual parchment” frame  
- [ ] Add toggle: Standard vs Weird Genesis  
- [ ] Save mock projects to localStorage (optional)

---

## Phase 5: 🎛️ Coddy Control Panel

**Goal:** Add site-wide UX features for interactivity, customization, and vibe control.

- [ ] Implement “Weird Mode” toggle (UI, voice, palette)  
- [ ] Vibe Slider: Calm <--> Chaotic (affects transition speed, visuals)  
- [ ] Persona Picker: “Builder Mode”, “IdeaSynth”, “Pattern Oracle” (changes Coddy’s voice/tips)  
- [ ] Coddy Prompts corner: recent quotes or whisper hints cycling every 10s  
- [ ] Remember last state across sessions

---

## Phase 6: 🧠 Coddy’s Philosophy & About You

**Goal:** Let visitors meet Coddy’s maker and understand your dev philosophy.

- [ ] Section: _“Meet the Builder”_ → your codified philosophy from LinkedIn bio  
- [ ] Highlight quote: _“I don’t replace myself with AI — I amplify myself.”_  
- [ ] Optional Coddy logbook: interactive journal of project evolution  
- [ ] Add external links: GitHub, roadmap.md, Coddy README, LinkedIn

---

## Phase 7: 🎨 Coddy’s Visual Identity & Posters Gallery

**Goal:** Showcase your original Coddy posters and vibe DNA.

- [ ] Add gallery slider: Poster 1 → 2 → 3  
- [ ] Click to expand, with glow border, poster notes and phrases  
- [ ] Optional: turn poster phrases into animated captions on main site  
- [ ] Add “Download Posters” button or print-safe layout toggle

---

## Phase 8: 🔁 Experimental Loop UI (Stretch)

**Goal:** Begin adding live “mini-loop” UI synced with Coddy dev progress

- [ ] Animate current task Coddy is “thinking on”  
- [ ] Add console-style ticker log showing updates  
- [ ] Sync with commits: `coddy just completed Phase 1.2 – CLI skeleton functional ✅`  
- [ ] Future: link to Coddy’s real output (code snippets, changelogs, etc.)

## AI-Guided Quality & Value Evaluation

- ✅ Evaluate:
  - Does the site reflect Coddy’s *personality* and technical purpose?
  - Do users understand how Coddy works and why it’s different?
  - Is the roadmap readable and reflective of real-time dev loops?
  - Does the demo flow *feel* like a ritual Coddy experience?
